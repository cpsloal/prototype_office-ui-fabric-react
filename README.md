A React App prototype using Office UI Fabric components.  Just to get familiar with Office UI Fabric components. 

The End Goal is to be able to create Office Add-ins.

> If you like raw, unrefined sugar, check out the __Long Form Recipe__ for what seems like step-by-step thought process and the birth of this prototype.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve the app from localhost:3000
npm start

# build application for production
npm run build

# run unit & end-to-end tests
npm test


```

Well, thats it folks.  We are done!  We can all go home now.

## Long Form Recipe

> This section contains step by step of how this prototype came to be (as its being built).  If a blog is written, then the link would be here and contain a more user-friendly documentation and descriptions.

### In the beginning ...
Starting with ...

https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/blob/master/ghdocs/OnBoarding/SampleApp.md



It is presumed that **NodeJS** is installed already.  Then from command prompt:

```
# Install tool needed to generate a react app scaffolding
npm install -g create-react-app

# Create a scaffolded React App
create-react-app prototype_office-ui-fabric-react

```

Following are the settings used when generating the project scaffolding:

>**Readme generated by create-react-app is [here](README.from.create.react.app.md)** 
> 
<br>

Then ...
```
# Install Office UI Fabric
cd prototype_office-ui-fabric-react
npm install office-ui-fabric-react --save

```


### Add DocumentCardBasic component
Following the instrunctions [here](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/blob/master/ghdocs/OnBoarding/SampleApp.md
) we now have the following:

### Host this app already...
We need to serve this page somehwere! Going to follow the docs/recommendations [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment) and going to try [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#github-pages)


```
# Install tool needed to generate and publish to GitHub Pages
yarn add --dev gh-pages

# Update packages.json with deploy script command:
# "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"

# Now deploy the app to GitHub Pages
yarn run deploy

```

Yeeeeepy! deployed to GitHub Pages (see the URL woooo!)
