> If you like raw, unrefined sugar, check out the __Long Form Recipe__ for what seems like step-by-step thought process and the birth of this prototype.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve the app from localhost:3000
npm start

# build electron application for production
npm run build

# run unit & end-to-end tests
npm test


# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
npm run lint

```

Well, thats it folks.  We are done!  We can all go home now.

## Long Form Recipe

> This section contains step by step of how this prototype came to be (as its being built).  If a blog is written, then the link would be here and contain a more user-friendly documentation and descriptions.
